Changelog ðŸ“ƒ :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated ``Anime Plugin``. Recoded anime.py and added new command ``.airing``. Try out all commands. Get more details by ``.plinfo anime``
* Updated ``.uninstall``. Now you can uninstall plugin even by giving ``.py`` extension. Previously this gave error. **Example :** ``.uninstall alive`` or ``.uninstall alive.py`` will work same.
* Updated ``adultzone``. Previously NSFW gifs would get saved in GIF tab which was a bit annoying. So now it'll not get saved in your GIF tab. Enjoy.
